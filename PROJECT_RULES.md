# Project Guidelines

## 1. Project Understanding

- Always read and understand the project before making any modifications to ensure you know the potential impact of changes.

## 2. Change Confirmation

- After implementing any change, wait for confirmation that it works before cleaning up chat history or proceeding further.

## 3. GitHub Rules

- Do **NOT** push changes to GitHub unless explicitly requested.
- When pushing to GitHub:
  - Update `README.md` with any new features, changes, or instructions.
  - Remove any unused or dead code.

## 4. Rollback Option

- Ensure every change can be reverted.
- Document rollback steps if needed.

## 5. Code Quality

- Keep code clean, well-structured, and maintainable.
- Follow best practices for readability and performance.

## 6. Communication

- Clarify unclear requirements before starting.
- Provide a short plan of the changes before implementation.

## 7. Testing

- Test changes locally before delivery.
- Ensure no breaking changes are introduced.
- Mention possible side effects for major updates.

## 8. Version Control Discipline

- Commit changes in small, logical chunks with meaningful commit messages.
- Avoid overwriting or squashing commits without approval.

## 9. Additional Recommendations

- Document any added or changed functions with comments.
- Keep dependencies up to date only after testing.
- Maintain consistent formatting using Prettier/ESLint rules.
